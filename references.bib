            Two novel magnetotactic bacteria (MTB) were isolated from sediment and water collected from the Badwater Basin, Death Valley National Park and southeastern shore of the Salton Sea, respectively, and were designated as strains BW-2 and SS-5, respectively. Both organisms are rod-shaped, biomineralize magnetite, and are motile by means of flagella. The strains grow chemolithoautotrophically oxidizing thiosulfate and sulfide microaerobically as electron donors, with thiosulfate oxidized stoichiometrically to sulfate. They appear to utilize the Calvin–Benson–Bassham cycle for autotrophy based on ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RubisCO) activity and the presence of partial sequences of RubisCO genes. Strains BW-2 and SS-5 biomineralize chains of octahedral magnetite crystals, although the crystals of SS-5 are elongated. Based on 16S rRNA gene sequences, both strains are phylogenetically affiliated with the Gammaproteobacteria class. Strain SS-5 belongs to the order Chromatiales; the cultured bacterium with the highest 16S rRNA gene sequence identity to SS-5 is Thiohalocapsa marina (93.0\%). Strain BW-2 clearly belongs to the Thiotrichales; interestingly, the organism with the highest 16S rRNA gene sequence identity to this strain is Thiohalospira alkaliphila (90.2\%), which belongs to the Chromatiales. Each strain represents a new genus. This is the first report of magnetite-producing MTB phylogenetically associated with the Gammaproteobacteria. This finding is important in that it significantly expands the phylogenetic diversity of the MTB. Physiology of these strains is similar to other MTB and continues to demonstrate their potential in nitrogen, iron, carbon and sulfur cycling in natural environments.},

              The phylogeny of the large bacterial class
              Gammaproteobacteria
              has been difficult to resolve. Here we apply a telescoping multiprotein approach to the problem for 104 diverse gammaproteobacterial genomes, based on a set of 356 protein families for the whole class and even larger sets for each of four cohesive subregions of the tree. Although the deepest divergences were resistant to full resolution, some surprising patterns were strongly supported. A representative of the
              Acidithiobacillales
              routinely appeared among the outgroup members, suggesting that in conflict with rRNA-based phylogenies this order does not belong to
              Gammaproteobacteria
              ; instead, it (and, independently, “
              Mariprofundus
              ”) diverged after the establishment of the
              Alphaproteobacteria
              yet before the betaproteobacteria/gammaproteobacteria split. None of the orders
              Alteromonadales
              ,
              Pseudomonadales
              , or
              Oceanospirillales
              were monophyletic; we obtained strong support for clades that contain some but exclude other members of all three orders. Extreme amino acid bias in the highly A+T-rich genome of
              Ca
              ndidatus
              Carsonella prevented its reliable placement within
              Gammaproteobacteria
              , and high bias caused artifacts that limited the resolution of the relationships of other insect endosymbionts, which appear to have had multiple origins, although the unbiased genome of the endosymbiont
              Sodalis
              acted as an attractor for them. Instability was observed for the root of the
              Enterobacteriales
              , with nearly equal subsets of the protein families favoring one or the other of two alternative root positions; the nematode symbiont
              Photorhabdus
              was identified as a disruptor whose omission helped stabilize the
              Enterobacteriales
              root.},
